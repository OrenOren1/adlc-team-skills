"""ADR-401 layout contract tests (RED gate).

Asserts the docs/adlc layout contract outcomes:
- shared path constants defined in paths.sh / paths.ps1
- gitignore allowlist replaces the wholesale ".adlc/" ignore
- no dead .adlc subdirs (architecture/context/skills)
- boot.sh dual-reads docs/adlc/memory and legacy .adlc/memory for counts
- PRD/AD/roadmap/ChDR outputs repointed under docs/adlc
- architect-boot primary ADR index under docs/adlc/memory (legacy fallback)
- AD-template links memory via relative memory/ paths

These tests MUST fail until the ADR-401 layout contract is implemented.
