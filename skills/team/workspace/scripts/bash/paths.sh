# --- Gitignore allowlist (ADR-401 R7, verbatim) ------------------------------
# Replaces the legacy wholesale `.adlc/` ignore. Order matters: negations must
# follow the `.adlc/*` blanket ignore. The report pair
# `.adlc/team-learn-report.md` AND `.adlc/team-levelup-report.md` keeps the
# legacy name ignored during the team-levelup rename transition.
